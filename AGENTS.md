Agents Guide
============

- Start with `context/index.md` to locate project background, submodules, and reference documents.
- When you add new files under `context/` or make significant updates, revise `context/index.md` to keep the directory map current.
- Capture major findings or decisions in new files within `context/` so future agents have persistent references.
