Agents Guide
============

- Start with `context/index.md` to locate project background, submodules, and reference documents.
- When you add new files under `context/` or make significant updates, revise `context/index.md` to keep the directory map current.
- Capture major findings or decisions in new files within `context/` so future agents have persistent references.
- Follow `context/plan.md`: confirm each phase's objectives with the user, agree on a test plan, practice TDD, record notes in the matching `context/phase-00N.md`, request a review, then revise the plan and remind the user to run `/new` before continuing.
