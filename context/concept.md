This document describes the concept of the SwiftPie project.

SwiftPie provides two things:

1. A Swift implementation of an HTTPie-like CLI tool.
2. A library for constructing "clientless" HTTPie-like CLI tools compatible with Vapor.

For an explanation of the "clientless" concept, see [./pier/README.md](Pier's README).

For an example of an existing HTTPie-like CLI tool that implements a subset
of HTTPie's features, see [./httpie-go](./httpie-go).
