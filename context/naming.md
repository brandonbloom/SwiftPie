SwiftPie Naming Notes
=====================

- **Project name:** SwiftPie — selected to keep the dessert theme, acknowledge Swift, and avoid confusion with HTTPie, Inc.
- **Executable:** `spie` — short, memorable alias that nods to HTTPie's `httpie` binary while emphasizing pie.
- **Prior name:** The project started life as "SwiftHTTPie"; references to that name should now be treated as historical only.
- **Branding guidance:** Describe SwiftPie as an HTTPie-compatible CLI and library. Do not label the project itself as "Swift HTTPie" in docs or UIs.
